# Soda Peaks API V.1.0.0

A database of lakes for the purposes of organizing relevant diving bathymetrics.

### Description
Soda Peaks API is a database of lake bathymetrics for the use of Soda Peaks Expeditions and the customers that visit [here](www.sodapeaks.com). Version 1.0.0 will mainly be for administrative use while enough data is collected. After the data has been recorded version 1.2.0 will be a forward facing maps component that visitors of the site will be able to use to plan their own diving expeditions. 

## Getting Started
Our database uses NodeJS packages, all dependencies are listed in our package.json so you'll need to install them if you want to run our Mongo database and our express servers. You must have an up-to-date NodeJS to install our dependencies, which you can find at their site https://nodejs.org/en/download/.     

Run

    npm i

then

    npm start

## Built With

  MongoDb, Express, NodeJS, Mongoose

## Testing

### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD)
The process for creating this app was done using the development technique of Test-Driven-Development. Our Back-end uses Test-Driven-Development when testing our routes and models. This is done to ensure our connections to our database are functioning before continuing on with further development, this practice is done to avoid app breaking bugs later on.

To run the tests, in your terminal run:

`npm run test`

## Deployment
This is app is live running on heroku servers https://rally-alchemy.herokuapp.com/
